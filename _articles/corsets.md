### How do I stay safe?

{% capture warn %}
There is little or no medical research into the health effects of wearing corsets. A literature search by Gender Construction Kit found only one medical study {% cite gau1998corsets %}. The long term health risks are entirely unknown.

There is a lot of conflicting information out there about the health risks of corsets.

Wearing a corset *loosely*, or for *short periods of time*, is likely to be fairly safe. However, tightly lacing the corset to reduce your waist size carries unknown health risks. In particular, the effects on young people whose bones are still developing has not been studied.

Like many tight-fitting garments, corsets can *restrict breathing*. Long-term wear of a *waist-training corset* can permanently affect your body. As with other tight-fitting clothing such as [binders]({% link _articles/binding.md %}), you may be able to reduce the risk by taking some precautions like:
* Making sure your corset is the *right size* and is suitable for your *body type*
* *Listening to your body*, and removing the corset if you feel any pain
* Taking *rest days* where you do not wear the corset
* Getting a *high quality* corset
* *Starting slow*, only wearing your corset for short periods of time at first, to allow both the corset and your body to get used to it
* *Tightening slowly*, wearing it slightly tighter each time, rather than immediately wearing it as tight as you can stand
* *Not wearing* it while *exercising* or *sleeping*

However, there is no real evidence out there showing how effective these techniques will be at reducing the risk.

### What kinds are there?

* A *waist-training corset* is a garment meant to be worn daily to permanently change the shape of your waist.
* A *waist cincher* is a garment that makes a temporary change to the size and shape of your waist.
